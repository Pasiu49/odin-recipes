            <li>1 (1 ounce) packet au jus gravy</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) packet ranch seasoning</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar pickled onions, such as Mt. Olive Simply Vidalia Pickled VidaliaÂ® Onion Strips</li>
            <li>4 cups low sodium beef stock, or as needed</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>

    <p>Recipe instructions:</p>

    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Add chuck roast to a slow cooker (no need to sear it first). Sprinkle roast with au jus packet, ranch seasoning packet. Pour pickled onions over roast.</li>
            <li>Cover the slow cooker; cook on High for 4 to 6 hours, or on Low 6 to 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Halfway through the cooking process, if you need to add some liquid, add beef stock as needed.</li>
            <li>When the roast is impossibly tender and falling apart, remove to shred. Return shredded beef to the liquid.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mash butter with flour to make a paste; stir butter mixture into beef and liquid to thicken gravy. Continue to cook for 30 minutes, uncovered.</li>
